# Open Oubliette

Explore a dungeon!  Fight monsters!  Collect treasure!

An [*oubliette*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oubliette) (from the French, "to forget"), is a kind of dungeon that is only accessible through a single trapdoor in the ceiling.

Please see [this blog post](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/2020/03/22/oubliette.html) for design notes.

## Setup

Players choose the order of succession in each turn, by each rolling one die, highest roll going first and ties re-rolling to decide their order.  Each player's token is placed on the Entrance/Exit space.

## Game Play

On each player's turn, the player will:

 * Roll two six-sided dice.
 * Move the number of spaces equal to the sum of both dice.
 * Draw a *Monster* card.
 * Fight the monster on their card.
 * If the fight is successful, draw a *Treasure* card.
 * If on one of the corner spaces, draw and apply an *Event* card.
 * If the player rolled doubles in the first step, the player may take another turn.

Fighting monsters, of course, has its own rules.

### Fights

Fighting is usually very simple.  However, some Treasure cards give the player who holds them the ability to change the numbers.  If the player opts to do this, the card no longer qualifies as Treasure.  Similarly, *Wound* cards make fighting more difficult by changing other numbers.

 * The player attacks, rolling two six-sided dice.
   - (Optional) If a *Treasure* card improves the attack, add its value to the to the sum of the dice when attacking.
 * If the player rolls a number equal to monster's power level or higher, the player wins and the process is over.
   - The sum of a player's two highest *Wound* cards is added to the power level of the monster for these purposes.
 * If the player rolls less than the monster's power level, the monster rolls two six-sided dice to attack.
 * If the monster's roll is equal to eight (8) or higher, the monster succeeds and the player draws a *Wound* card.
   - The sum of a player's two highest *Wound* cards is added to the roll of any monster attacking the player.
   - (Optional) If the *Treasure* card improves the defense, add it to the standard defense (8) when the monster attacks the player.
 * If the monster's roll is less than eight (8)---as modified by *Treasure* cards---the monster's attack fails and the monster leaves with its treasure, ending the fight.

If neither the player nor the monster has won, then someone has escaped, ending the fight.

If a player lands on a space where another player is already waiting, the arriving player can opt to attack the other before interacting with a monster.  The player winning the fight takes three (3) random *Treasure* cards from the victim, but will always draw a *Wound* card to represent damage taken in the ambush.

### Additional Turns

If, at the start of a player's turn, the player's roll to move comes up as doubles (both dice showing the same number), the player may opt to take another turn when the current turn is over.

## The Exit

Whenever a player lands on or passes the *Exit* space, the player can opt to take a couple of actions that end the turn.

 * **Recovery**:  The player places up to three (3) of their current *Wound* cards back in the pile, essentially resting to recover.
 * **Treasure**:  All the player's *Treasure* cards that haven't been used for their functionality as weapons or armor are cashed in for their face value.  Treasure that has been cashed in cannot be stolen by other players.

If the player ever lands on the *Exit* space, the player also gains the ability to move in either direction, deciding the direction after their roll.

## Win Conditions

The game is over when one of the two following conditions is met.

First, the first player to cash in a total of $6,000 in *Treasure* cards at the *Exit* automatically wins the game.

Second, in cases where *Oubliette* runs out of unclaimed *Treasure* cards, the player who has the highest value from cashed-in *Treasure* cards wins the game.

In the event of a tie in the second case, *Treasure* cards that have **not** been cashed in, including those being used for weapons or armor, can count towards the total for the purpose of breaking the tie.

If the score is **still** even, *Treasure* cards used as weapons and armor can count.

## Landlord's Game Rules

If using **Oubliette** in place of the Jail in **The Landlord's Game**, make the following changes to game play:

 * The player only has three Turns, taken instead of their **Landlord's Game** turns waiting in Jail; no business may be transacted from the oubliette.
 * Any *Treasure* cards that haven't been cashed in at the *Exit* by the end of three turns are lost.
 * Any *Treasure* cards that **have** been cashed in are converted to money in the host game at the rate of g10 to $1 or equivalent currency.
 * There is no Win Condition.  After three Turns, the player leaves the oubliette and returns all **Oubliette** cards to their appropriate decks.

In all other cases, the rules are the same.
